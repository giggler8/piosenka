           <p>I wake up everyday its a daydream
              Everythin in my life isnt what it seems
              I wake up just to go back to sleep
              I act real shallow but Im in to deep
              And all I care about is sex and violence
              And a heavy bass line is my kind of silence</p><br>
            
             Everybody says I got to get a grip
             But I let sanity give me the slip
             Some people think Im bonkers
             But I just think Im free
             Man Im just living my life
             There nothing crazy about me
             Some people pay for thrills
             but I get mine for free
             Man Im just living my life
             There nothing crazy about me
             (Bonkers)
